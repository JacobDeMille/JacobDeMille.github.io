                <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>Hi Friends! </p>
                <p>
                My name is Kilee DeMille and I am a passionate, lasagna loving, fabric snob.  I found my love for sewing when I was first introduced at the age of 8.  My grandma Ann, who the shop is named after, decided it was time to introduce her oldest granddaughter to one of her passions.  I started with hand stitching and soon moved to machine sewing.  Every summer growing up my mom would make us pick a project, find the pattern and fabric, and work to complete it before school started.  Though this my love of sewing started.</p>
                <p>
                I've made a few quilts here and there, sewn a few dresses and crocheted a thing or two but the real idea for Ann's came about when I worked for an online shop over one summer during my twenties.  We had just moved home with my parents for the summer and I was in need of something to do.  As soon as I got the job, it rekindled my drive for fabric.  We worked with clients from all over the United States, Canada, and Australia.  I loved the new collections coming in and sorting the new fabrics.  It was then I decided I would one day start my own fabric store.  I mean how hard can it be right? Ha!  Little did I know the amount of work that went into online sales.</p>
                <p>
                Through the years I have tested, grown and cried through this learning experience.  I am grateful you have decided to join me on this journey and hope you will stay for a long time.  Join our email list or send me a message and let's get sewing! Can't wait to see what you make.</p>
