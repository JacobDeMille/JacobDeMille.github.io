                <p class="info">Rising elegantly among towering Douglas-fir trees, the six spires of the marble-clad
                    Portland Oregon Temple create a beautiful sight for motorists traveling Oregon's I-5, situated about
                    8 miles south of downtown Portland in Lake Oswego. On the east side of the temple is a serene
                    reflection pool sitting at the base of the main spire. A fountain on the west side replenishes an
                    infinity pool. Visitors are welcome to walk among the gorgeous gardens that decorate the temple
                    grounds and to obtain additional information at the public visitors' center that features films,
                    displays, multimedia presentations, and a stunning reproduction of Thorvaldsen's Christus statue.

                    <p>Enjoy the lush gardens on the Portland Temple grounds, then come inside the visitors' center to
                        learn more about Jesus Christ and the purpose of temples. On February 25, 2012, the Portland
                        Oregon Temple Visitors' Center opened its doors to the public. On June 9, 2013, it was formally
                        dedicated by Bishop Gary E. Stevenson. The visitors' center is located next to the temple in a
                        building that originally housed Distribution Services. When Distribution Services was relocated
                        by a Deseret Book, a short distance away, it was decided that the building would be converted to
                        a visitors' center.</p>

                <p>The Portland Oregon Temple was the first temple built in Oregon.

                    The Portland Oregon Temple sits on land originally purchased in the 1960s for a Church junior college. Later, when the decision was reversed, 7.3 acres were retained for the temple.
                    
                    The Portland Oregon Temple was constructed directly on the Willamette Meridian, which is the principle north-south meridian for all land surveys conducted in the states of Oregon and Washington.
                    
                    The two-story Celestial Room of the Portland Oregon Temple features three chandeliers, long wall tapestries, and a grand staircase.
                    
                    On the top floor of the Portland Oregon Temple are a collection of sealing rooms with white marble altars and a large assembly hall.
                    
                    The floor plan created for the Portland Oregon Temple was adapted and used for the Las Vegas Nevada Temple.
