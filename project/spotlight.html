                <p id="info">Rising elegantly among towering Douglas-fir trees, the six spires of the marble-clad Portland Oregon Temple create a beautiful sight for motorists traveling Oregon's I-5, situated about 8 miles south of downtown Portland in Lake Oswego. On the east side of the temple is a serene reflection pool sitting at the base of the main spire. A fountain on the west side replenishes an infinity pool. Visitors are welcome to walk among the gorgeous gardens that decorate the temple grounds and to obtain additional information at the public visitors' center that features films, displays, multimedia presentations, and a stunning reproduction of Thorvaldsen's Christus statue.</p>

                    <p>Enjoy the lush gardens on the Portland Temple grounds, then come inside the visitors' center to
                        learn more about Jesus Christ and the purpose of temples. On February 25, 2012, the Portland Oregon Temple Visitors' Center opened its doors to the public. On June 9, 2013, it was formally dedicated by Bishop Gary E. Stevenson. The visitors' center is located next to the temple in a building that originally housed Distribution Services. When Distribution Services was relocated by a Deseret Book, a short distance away, it was decided that the building would be converted to a visitors' center.</p>
